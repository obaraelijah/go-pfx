## Structure

The repository contains the following packages:
- `pfx` - User facing API. Will eventually be stable.
- `hal` - Internal hardware abstraction layer. Expect breaking changes.
- `internal/`
  - `appkit` - macOS windowing backend.
  - `metal` - Metal rendering backend.

Platforms not listed here, such as those with licensing restrictions, can be supported by implementing the `hal` layer.
This allows you to benefit from the `pfx` abstraction and a unified codebase.
